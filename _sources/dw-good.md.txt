# BDirectWindow

The {cpp:class}`BDirectWindow` class gives your code direct access to the
graphics frame buffer on the video card. Unlike {cpp:class}`BWindowScreen`,
{cpp:class}`BDirectWindow` can be used in both full-screen and window
modes—you can create a {cpp:class}`BDirectWindow` that looks just like a
normal window, but lets your code draw into it by directly accessing the
frame buffer.

In addition,  {cpp:class}`BDirectWindow` lets you switch between
full-screen exclusive mode and windowed modes without breaking down and
rebuilding the object. A simple call to the
{cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::SetFullScreen` function does the job.

:::{admonition} Note
:class: note
if you want your direct window to be full-screen but don't want exclusive
mode, just resize the window to fill the entire screen; since full-screen
exclusive mode (as set by calling
{cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::SetFullScreen`) won't let other windows draw in
front of your direct window, you can't have menus in a full-screen
exclusive mode direct window.
:::

Another difference between  {cpp:class}`BDirectWindow` and
{cpp:class}`BWindowScreen` is that  {cpp:class}`BDirectWindow` lets you
access all the {cpp:class}`BWindow` functions; you can literally treat your
{cpp:class}`BDirectWindow` just like another window. There are two
caveats:

:::{admonition} Warning
:class: warning
Don't draw into the direct window from its own thread; you should spawn
another thread for drawing into the direct window.

And use the {cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` function to
synchronize the interaction between  {cpp:class}`BDirectWindow` and your
drawing thread. Also, if you choose to use {cpp:class}`BWindow` or
{cpp:class}`BView` API inside a  {cpp:class}`BDirectWindow`, be sure you
don't block the {cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` function.
:::

Not all video cards support window mode; use the
{cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::SupportsWindowMode` function if you need to know
whether or not window mode is available.

## Getting Connected (and Staying That Way)

The key to the  {cpp:class}`BDirectWindow` class is the
{cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` function, which your code must
implement. This function is called whenever a change that your drawing code
may need to be aware of occurs.

When your {cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` function is called,
it's passed a pointer to a {htype}`direct_buffer_info` structure, as
follows:

:::{code}
typedef struct {
   direct_buffer_state   buffer_state;
   direct_driver_state   driver_state;
   void*                 bits;
   void*                 pci_bits;
   int32                 bytes_per_row;
   uint32                bits_per_pixel;
   color_space           pixel_format;
   buffer_layout         layout;
   buffer_orientation    orientation;
   uint32                _reserved[9];
   uint32                _dd_type_;
   uint32                _dd_token_;
   uint32                clip_list_count;
   clipping_rect         window_bounds;
   clipping_rect         clip_bounds;
   clipping_rect         clip_list[1];
} direct_buffer_info;

:::

The {htype}`clipping_rect` structure is:

:::{code}
typedef struct {
   int32      left;
   int32      top;
   int32      right;
   int32      bottom;
} clipping_rect;
:::

Note that, as always, these edges are inclusive; for example, if left is 5
and top is 3, the pixel at (5,3) is included in the rectangle's contents.

The data in the {htype}`direct_buffer_info` structure is only valid until
{hmethod}`DirectConnected()` returns, so if you need to reference any of
the information later, you should make a copy of the fields you need.

:::

## Window Mode vs. Full Screen Mode

There are some differences in how {cpp:class}`BDirectWindow` behaves
depending on whether it's in window mode or full-screen exclusive mode.

In window mode, the {cpp:class}`BDirectWindow` behaves almost exactly like
a {cpp:class}`BWindow`—so much so that you can use a
{cpp:class}`BDirectWindow` in any situation you'd normally use a
{cpp:class}`BWindow`. The window_bounds rectangles are the same size and
shape as the window itself, as you'd expect. If exclusive window mode is
available ( {cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::SupportsWindowMode` returns
{cpp:enum}`true`), {cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` will be
called as described above, thereby providing the means to directly access
the frame buffer. If the graphics card doesn't support exclusive access to
the frame buffer while in window mode,
{cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` will never be called, and you
can only use {cpp:class}`BWindow` and {cpp:class}`BView` APIs to work in
the window.

In full-screen exclusive mode, the window_bounds are actually the size and
shape of the entire screen, even if the screen isn't the same size as the
direct window you created. You have to handle the difference yourself.

Full-screen exclusive mode also guarantees that your window will always be
the focus, always be in front, and will always stay full-screen (the
application server will resize the window for you if the screen resolution
changes). Since no other windows can come in front of a full-screen
exclusive direct window, any Interface Kit objects that use a window to
display their contents won't work; this includes any type of menu.

If you want your {cpp:class}`BDirectWindow` to be full-screen, but still
compatible with menus or other windows, create it as a non-exclusive
window, then use the following code:

:::{code}
BScreen screen(this);
MoveTo(0,0);
ResizeTo(screen.width, screen.height);
:::

This will make the non-exclusive direct window fill the entire screen.
Keep in mind that in this case, other windows may appear in front of yours,
and if the screen resolution changes, you will have to resize the window
yourself if you want to continue to fill the entire screen.

## Using a Direct Window

Let's put together a simple class, derived from
{cpp:class}`BDirectWindow`, that demonstrates the basics of drawing into a
direct window.

:::{code}
class DirectSample : public BDirectWindow {
public:
                   DirectSample(BRect frame);
                   ~DirectSample();
    virtual bool   QuitRequested();
    virtual void   DirectConnected(direct_buffer_info *info);

    uint8*         fBits;
    int32          fRowBytes;
    color_space    fFormat;
    clipping_rect  fBounds;

    uint32         fNumClipRects;
    clipping_rect* fClipList;

    bool           fDirty;      // needs refresh?
    bool           fConnected;
    bool           fConnectionDisabled;
    BLocker*       locker;
    thread_id      fDrawThreadID;
};
:::

The {hclass}`DirectSample` class implements a constructor as well as the
{cpp:func}`~BApplication::QuitRequested` and
{cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` functions.

Some variables are added to the class for cacheing information about the
frame buffer.

:::{list-table}

widths: auto
---
-
	- Field

	- Description

-
	- 	fBits

	- 	Will contain a pointer to the frame buffer's bitmap.

-
	- 	fRowBytes

	- 	Will contain the number of bytes per row of screen data.

-
	- 	fFormat

	- 	Will contain the pixel format (such as {cpp:enum}`B_CMAP8` for 8-bit
indexed color graphics mode). Our sample program will only work in this
mode.

-
	- 	fBounds

	- 	will contain the bounds rectangle for the window.

-
	- 	fNumClipRects

	- 	Will contain the number of rectangles in the clip rectangle list.

-
	- 	fClipList

	- 	Is the actual list of clip rectangles, and will be allocated on-the-fly as
needed.

-
	- 	fDirty

	- 	Will be {cpp:enum}`true` if the window needs to be redrawn.

-
	- 	fConnected

	- 	Is {cpp:enum}`true` if the window is connected to the frame buffer.

-
	- 	fConnectionDisabled

	- 	Is {cpp:enum}`true` if the window is in the process of being closed.

-
	- 	locker

	- 	Is a {cpp:class}`BLocker` that will be used to ensure mutual exclusion
when the frame buffer or buffer information data we've cached is being
manipulated.

-
	- 	fDrawThreadID

	- 	Contains the {htype}`thread_id` of the drawing thread, which is
responsible for drawing the contents of the window.
:::

The specifics of what these variables are and why the information
contained in them is maintained will be discussed when we get to the
{cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` and {hmethod}`DrawingThread()`
functions.

The constructor for the {hclass}`DirectSample` class looks like this:

:::{code}
DirectSample::DirectSample(BRect frame)
             : BDirectWindow(frame, "DirectWindow Sample",
                             B_TITLED_WINDOW,
                             B_NOT_RESIZABLE|B_NOT_ZOOMABLE)
{
   fConnected = false;
   fConnectionDisabled = false;
   locker = new BLocker();
   fClipList = NULL;
   fNumClipRects = 0;

   AddChild(new SampleView(Bounds()));

   if (!SupportsWindowMode()) {
      SetFullScreen(true);
   }

   fDirty = true;
   fDrawThreadID = spawn_thread(DrawingThread, "drawing_thread",
                  B_NORMAL_PRIORITY, (void *) this);
   resume_thread(fDrawThreadID);
   Show();
}
:::

This code establishes the direct window by deferring to
{cpp:class}`BDirectWindow`. Then the fConnected and fConnectionDisabled
flags are initialized to indicate that the window isn't connected yet, but
the connection isn't in the process of being torn down by the
{hclass}`DirectSample` destructor. The locker is created, and the clip
rectangle list is initialized to a {cpp:enum}`NULL` pointer, with a count
of 0.

Then it adds a child view that occupies the entire window. The primary
purpose of this view in this sample is to set the view color to
{cpp:enum}`B_TRANSPARENT_32_BIT`, to prevent the application server from
erasing the window with a default color.

If the video card doesn't support window mode, we call
{cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::SetFullScreen` to switch the direct window into
full-screen exclusive mode. This guarantees that you'll get connected with
direct screen access (in a window if possible, otherwise in full-screen
exclusive mode). If you don't use
{cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::SetFullScreen`, and window mode isn't supported,
{cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` will never be called, and you
won't have direct screen access.

Then the fDirty flag is set to {cpp:enum}`true`, which indicates that the
window needs to be updated, and the drawing thread is started; the drawing
thread will handle all actual drawing into the window. The argument passed
to the drawing thread is a pointer to the {hclass}`DirectSample` window
itself. You should always use a separate thread for drawing into a
{cpp:class}`BDirectWindow`.

Finally, {cpp:func}`~BWindow::Show` is called to make the direct window
visible.

The destructor needs to make sure there's no chance someone will try to
draw while the window is being destructed:

:::{code}
DirectSample::~DirectSample() {
   int32 result;

   fConnectionDisabled = true;      // Connection is dying
   Hide();
   Sync();
   wait_for_thread(fDrawThreadID, &result);
   free(fClipList);
   delete locker;
}
:::

The first thing the destructor does is set the fConnectionDisabled flag to
{cpp:enum}`true`, which indicates that the window is in the process of
being destroyed, and that future calls to
{cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` or the drawing thread should be
ignored. The window is then hidden by calling {cpp:func}`~BWindow::Hide`.
Finally, {cpp:func}`~BWindow::Sync` is called to block until the window is
actually hidden.

{cpp:func}`~wait::for` waits until the drawing thread terminates. The
drawing thread (as we'll see shortly) is designed to terminate when the
fConnectionDisabled flag is {cpp:enum}`true`.

Then the clip rectangle list is freed and the locker deleted.

The {cpp:func}`~BApplication::QuitRequested` function is implemented as
usual.

The {cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` function is called
whenever a change occurs that affects how your code should access the frame
buffer:

:::{code}
void DirectSample::DirectConnected(direct_buffer_info *info) {
   if (!fConnected && fConnectionDisabled) {
      return;
   }
   locker->Lock();

   switch(info->buffer_state & B_DIRECT_MODE_MASK) {
      case B_DIRECT_START:
         fConnected = true;

      case B_DIRECT_MODIFY:
         // Get clipping information

         if (fClipList) {
            free(fClipList);
            fClipList = NULL;
         }

         fNumClipRects = info->clip_list_count;
         fClipList = (clipping_rect *)
               malloc(fNumClipRects*sizeof(clipping_rect));

         if (fClipList) {
            memcpy(fClipList, info->clip_list,
                  fNumClipRects*sizeof(clipping_rect));
            fBits = (uint8 *) info->bits;
            fRowBytes = info->bytes_per_row;
            fFormat = info->pixel_format;
            fBounds = info->window_bounds;
            fDirty = true;

         }
         break;

      case B_DIRECT_STOP:
         fConnected = false;
         break;
   }
   locker->Unlock();
}
:::

{cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` begins by checking the
fConnected and fConnectionDisabled flags; the code in
{cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` is only run if the connection
is opened (fConnected is {cpp:enum}`true`) or if we want to start it again
(fConnectionDisabled is {cpp:enum}`false`). This arrangement prevents the
{cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` function from trying to
reconnect if the destructor has started running. Otherwise, the locker is
locked, to prevent {cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` and the
drawing thread from colliding.

If the buffer state is {cpp:enum}`B_DIRECT_START`, the fConnected flag is
set to {cpp:enum}`true`. This keeps track of the fact that the application
server has given permission to draw directly into the region of the frame
buffer controlled by the direct window.

If the buffer state is {cpp:enum}`B_DIRECT_START` or
{cpp:enum}`B_DIRECT_MODIFY` (in which case the {htype}`direct_buffer_info`
structure describes changes to the frame buffer), any previously-existing
clip rectangle list is deleted, then we cache the information that
interests us and set the fDirty flag to {cpp:enum}`true` (to indicate that
the display needs to be redrawn to reflect the changed graphics settings).

The clip list is also cached by saving the number of rectangles in the
list in the fNumClipRects field and by making a copy of the clip list into
a newly malloc()d block of memory.

If the state is {cpp:enum}`B_DIRECT_STOP`, the fConnected flag is set to
{cpp:enum}`false`, to indicate that we shouldn't draw into the frame buffer
anymore.

Finally, the locker is unlocked, which lets the drawing thread start
running again.

Now let's have a look at {hmethod}`DrawingThread()`; this function serves
as the drawing thread, and is a global function:

:::{code}
int32 DrawingThread(void* data) {
   DirectSample* w;

   w = (DirectSample*) data;
   while (!w->fConnectionDisabled) {
      w->locker->Lock();
      if (w->fConnected) {
         if (w->fFormat == B_CMAP8 && w->fDirty) {
            int32 y;
            int32 width;
            int32 height;
            int32 adder;
            uint8 *p;
            clipping_rect *clip;
            int32 i;

            adder = w->fRowBytes;   // Stash locally for this pass
            for (i=0; i<w->fNumClipRects; i++) {
               clip = &(w->fClipList[i]);
               width = (clip->right - clip->left)+1;
               height = (clip->bottom - clip->top)+1;
               p = w->fBits+(clip->top*w->fRowBytes)+clip->left;
               y = 0;
               while (y < height) {
                  memset(p, 0x00, width);
                  y++;
                  p+=adder;
               }
            }
         }
         w->fDirty = false;
      }
      w->locker->Unlock();
      // Use BWindow or BView APIs here if you want
      snooze(16000);
   }
   return B_OK;
}
:::

{hmethod}`DrawingThread()` starts by casting the argument, {hparam}`data`,
into a pointer to the {hclass}`DirectSample` window into which it will be
drawing.

The `while` loop that follows will continue to run as long as the
fConnectionDisabled flag is {cpp:enum}`true`—in other words, it will keep
looping as long as the connection is enabled.

The drawing loop itself begins by locking the locker to ensure that
{cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` doesn't change anything while
we're working, then checking to be sure the connection is opened
(fConnected is {cpp:enum}`true`). If the connection is open, we verify that
format of the window is still 8-bit color and that the display needs to be
updated. If the display needs updating and the pixel format is still
{cpp:enum}`B_CMAP8`, the drawing code begins.

The fRowBytes field of the {hclass}`DirectSample` window is cached in a
local variable called adder. Then each rectangle in the clip list is drawn,
one at a time, using a `for` loop.

A pointer to the clip rectangle to be drawn is stored in clip, and the
width and height of the rectangle are computed. Then p is set to be a
pointer to the first pixel in the frame buffer that's contained by the clip
rectangle. Since 8-bit color pixels each occupy exactly one byte of video
memory, this pixel's address can be computed by taking the base fBits
pointer, adding the number of bytes per row times the number of rows
between the top of the screen and the first row in the clip rectangle, then
adding the number of bytes between the left edge of the screen and the left
edge of the clip rectangle, as seen in the line:

:::{code}
p = w->fBits+(clip->top*w->fRowBytes)+clip->left;
:::

Then a `while` loop is used to iterate over each line in the clip
rectangle, by ranging the variable y from 0 to the height of the clip
rectangle. memset() is used to clear the row to black, which is represented
by the byte value 0x00. y is incremented by one for each pass through the
loop, to count the rows being drawn for each iteration, and the pointer p
is incremented by adder to move down to the beginning of the next row in
the clip rectangle.

Once each clip rectangle has been drawn, the `for` loop exits, and the
fDirty flag is set to {cpp:enum}`false` to indicate that the screen is
up-to-date. Once that's done, the locker is unlocked, which lets
{cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` do its thing if it's called. To
avoid using an unreasonable amount of processing time, {ref}`snooze()` is
called to give up CPU time to other threads.

If you want to use calls to {cpp:class}`BWindow` or {cpp:class}`BView` API
in your drawing thread, you should do so just after unlocking the window.

When the thread terminates (which will only happen when the connection is
disabled), the drawing thread returns {cpp:enum}`B_OK`.

This drawing function is designed to draw nothing unless it's necessary;
{cpp:func}`~BDirectWindow::DirectConnected` will set the fDirty flag when
something happens to cause the screen to need a refresh, and other code
elsewhere in the application could also set the fDirty flag to indicate
that the screen should be redrawn.

Since we're taking over drawing the contents of the window, we need to
tell the application server not to draw anything. This is done by adding
the following line to the constructor for the SampleView:

:::{code}
SetViewColor(B_TRANSPARENT_32_BIT);
:::

This is very important: if you don't remember to do this, you'll have all
kinds of synchronization problems when the application server and your
drawing code try to draw into the window at the same time.

Note that this sample code doesn't really do anything useful (if all you
want to do is have a black window moving around, don't use
{cpp:class}`BDirectWindow`—use a regular {cpp:class}`BWindow`, throw a
{cpp:class}`BView` into it, and use {cpp:func}`~BView::SetViewColor` to
make the view black; it'll be faster and more efficient because it will use
hardware graphics acceleration if it's available). However, it serves as a
simple example of how to establish a connection to let your own drawing
code directly access the screen. Just replace the code inside the drawing
loop with something more useful (like a nifty real-time animation).
