# Graphics Card Hook Functions

## define_cursor()Index: 0



Tells the driver to create a cursor image as defined by the arguments. The
first two arguments, {hparam}`xorMask` and {hparam}`andMask`, are bit
vectors that represent the cursor image laid out in concatenated,
byte-aligned rows (top to bottom). Parallel bits from the two vectors
define the color of a single cursor pixel:

:::{list-table}
---
header-rows: 1
align: left
widths: auto
---
-
	- {hparam}`xorMask`

	- {hparam}`andMask`

	- Description

-
	- 0

	- 0

	- White; replace the screen pixel with a white cursor pixel.

-
	- 1

	- 0

	- Black; replace the screen pixel with a black cursor pixel.

-
	- 0

	- 1

	- Transparent; let the color of the underlying screen pixel show through.

-
	- 1

	- 1

	- Inversion; invert the color of the screen pixel.


:::

The second two arguments, {hparam}`width` and {hparam}`height`, are the
size of the cursor image in pixels. (Currently, the Application Server
supports only 16x16 cursors.)

The ({hparam}`hotX`, {hparam}`hotY`) arguments define the "hot spot"â€”the
pixel that precisely locates the cursor. Hot spot coordinates are relative
to the cursor rectangle itself, where the pixel at the left top corner of
the cursor image is (0, 0) and the one at the right bottom corner is
({hparam}`width`-1, {hparam}`height`-1).

If the cursor is currently showing (i.e. not hidden), this function should
display the cursor image.

## move_cursor()Index: 1



Tells the driver to move the cursor so the hot spot corresponds to
({hparam}`screenX`, {hparam}`screenY`). The arguments are display area
coordinates (not frame buffer coordinates).

## show_cursor()Index: 2



If the {hparam}`flag` argument is {cpp:expr}`true`, the driver should show
the cursor image on-screen; if it's {cpp:expr}`false`, it should remove the
cursor from the screen.

If the driver is asked to show the cursor before
{cpp:func}`define_cursor() <define::cursor>` is called, it should show it
at (0, 0).

## draw_line_with_8_bit_depth()Index: 3



Tells the driver to draw a straight, 8-bit color, minimally thin line.

-   The line begins at ({hparam}`startX`, {hparam}`startY`) and ends at
({hparam}`endX`, {hparam}`endY`), inclusive. The arguments are frame buffer
coordinates.

-   {hparam}`colorIndex` gives the color of the line as an index into the
8-bit color table.

-   If {hparam}`clipToRect` is {cpp:expr}`true`, the function should draw only
the portion of the line that lies within the clipping rectangle defined by
the last four arguments. The sides of the rectangle are included in the
drawing area. If {hparam}`clipToRect` is {cpp:expr}`false`, the final four
arguments should be ignored

To produce minimal thinness, the line should color only one pixel per row
or column, as the absolute slope of the line is more or less than 45
degrees; in other words, the line should move between rows or columns on
the diagonal, not by overlapping. Here's how you should (and shouldn't)
produce a mostly-vertical line; for the mostly-horizontal version, turn
your head sideways:

![Drawing Line With 8 Bit Depth](./images/TheGameKit/draw_line_with_8_bit_depth.png)

## draw_line_with_32_bit_depth()Index: 4



This is the same as {ref}`draw_line_with_8_bit_depth()` except for the
color argument. Here, {hparam}`color` is a 32-bit value with 8-bit red,
green, blue, and alpha components. The components are arranged in the order
that the driver specified when it received the
{cpp:enumerator}`B_GET_GRAPHICS_CARD_INFO` request.

## draw_rect_with_8_bit_depth()Index: 5



Tells the driver to fill a rectangle, specified by the first four
arguments, with the color at {hparam}`colorIndex` in the 8-bit color table.
The arguments are frame buffer coordinates. The sides of the rectangle
should be included in the area being filled.

## draw_rect_with_32_bit_depth()Index: 6



This is the same as {ref}`draw_rect_with_8_bit_depth()` except for the
{hparam}`color` argument. Here, {hparam}`color` is a 32-bit value with
8-bit red, green, blue, and alpha components. The components are arranged
in the order that the driver specified when it received the
{cpp:enumerator}`B_GET_GRAPHICS_CARD_INFO` request.

## blit()Index: 7



Tells the driver to copy pixel data from a source rectangle to a
destination rectangle. All coordinates and sizes are in frame buffer space.
The left top pixel of the source rectangle is at ({hparam}`sourceX`,
{hparam}`sourceY`) in the frame buffer. The left top pixel of the
destination rectangle is at ({hparam}`destinationX`,
{hparam}`destinationY`) in the frame buffer. Both rectangles are
{hparam}`width` pixels wide and {hparam}`height` pixels high. The
{hparam}`width` and {hparam}`height` arguments will always contain positive
values, and the rectangles are guaranteed to lie wholly within the frame
buffer.

## draw_array_with_8_bit_depth(), indexed_color_lineIndex: 8



Tells the driver to draw an array of lines in 8-bit depth. The line
{hparam}`array` holds a total of {hparam}`numItems`. Each item is specified
as an {htype}`indexed_color_line` structure, which contains the following
fields (all coordinates are in frame buffer space):

:::{list-table}
---
header-rows: 1
align: left
widths: auto
---
-
	- Field

	- Description

-
	- int16x1
	- The x coordinate of one end of the line.
-
	- int16y1
	- The y coordinate of one end of the line.
-
	- int16x2
	- The x coordinate of the other end of the line.
-
	- int16y2
	- The y coordinate of the other end of the line.
-
	- int16color
	- The color of the line, expressed as an index into the color map.

:::

If {hparam}`clipToRect` is {cpp:expr}`true`, the function should draw only
the portions of the lines that lie within the clipping rectangle defined by
the last four arguments. The sides of the rectangle are included in the
drawing area. If {hparam}`clipToRect` is {cpp:expr}`false`, the final four
arguments should be ignored

The lines should be minimally thin, as described under
{ref}`draw_line_with_8_bit_depth()`

## draw_array_with_32_bit_depth(), rgb_color_lineIndex: 9



Except for the color specification, which is encoded in the
{htype}`rgb_color_line` structure, this is the same as
{ref}`draw_array_with_8_bit_depth()`. The {htype}`rgb_color_line` structure
contains these fields:

:::{list-table}
---
header-rows: 1
align: left
widths: auto
---
-
	- Field

	- Description

-
	- int16x1
	- The x coordinate of one end of the line.
-
	- int16y1
	- The y coordinate of one end of the line.
-
	- int16x2
	- The x coordinate of the other end of the line.
-
	- int16y2
	- The y coordinate of the other end of the line.
-
	- rgb_colorcolor
	- The color of the line, expressed as a full 32-bit value.

## sync()Index: 10



The driver should implement this function to block until all other
currently-executing hook functions have finished. (More accurately, you
only have to wait for those hook functions that actually touch the frame
buffer.) The return value is ignored.

You should only implement this function if the card can perform any of the
hook functions asynchronously. If all hook functions are synchronous, you
should set the index 10 function to {cpp:expr}`NULL`.

After receiving a sync() call, your driver won't receive anymore hook
functions until sync() returns. Thus, you don't have to guard against
in-coming hook functions while sitting in sync().

## invert_rect()Index: 11



Tells the driver to invert the colors in the rectangle specified by the
arguments. The sides of the rectangle are included in the inversion.

## draw_line_with_16_bit_depth()Index: 12



This is the same as {ref}`draw_line_with_8_bit_depth()` except for the
color argument. Here, {hparam}`color` is a 16-bit value with red, green,
blue, and (possibly) alpha components. The components are arranged in the
order that the driver specified when it received the
{cpp:enumerator}`B_GET_GRAPHICS_CARD_INFO` request.

## draw_rect_with_16_bit_depth()Index: 13



This is the same as {ref}`draw_rect_with_8_bit_depth()` except for the
color argument. Here, {hparam}`color` is a 16-bit value with red, green,
blue, and (possibly) alpha components. The components are arranged in the
order that the driver specified when it received the
{cpp:enumerator}`B_GET_GRAPHICS_CARD_INFO` request.
