This isn't about graphics. An image is compiled code, of which there are
three types: app images, library images, and add-on images. An app image is
executable code that can be launched. A library image is a collection of
shared code that you link against when you're compiling your application.
An add-on image is code that an app can load and run while the app itself
is running. Note that an add-on can also be an app; in other words, you can
create an image that can be launched by itself, or that can be loaded into
another application.

For more information on creating and using images, see "{ref}`Image
Overview`".

## Image Functions

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} status_t get_image_info(image_id image, image_info* info)
:::

:::{cpp:function} status_t get_next_image_info(team_id team, int32* cookie, image_info* info)
:::

:::{code} c
struct {} image_info
:::

These functions copy, into the {hparam}`info` argument, the
{htype}`image_info` structure for a particular image. The get_image_info()
function gets the information for the image identified by {hparam}`image`.

The get_next_image_info() function lets you step through the list of a
team's images through iterated calls. The {hparam}`team` argument
identifies the team you want to look at; a {hparam}`team` value of 0 means
the team of the calling thread. The {hparam}`cookie` argument is a
placemark; you set it to 0 on your first call, and let the function do the
rest. The function returns {cpp:enumerator}`B_BAD_VALUE` when there are no
more images to visit:

:::{code} c
/* Get the image_info for every image in this team. */
image_info info;
int32 cookie = 0;

while (get_next_image_info(0, &cookie, &info) == B_OK)
   ...
:::

The {htype}`image_info` structure is:

:::{code} c
typedef struct {
    image_id   id;
    image_type type;
    int32      sequence;
    int32      init_order;
    B_PFV      init_routine;
    B_PFV      term_routine;
    dev_t      device;
    ino_t      node;
    char       name[MAXPATHLEN];
    void*      text;
    void*      data;
    int32      text_size;
    int32      data_size;
} image_info;

:::{cpp:function} status_t get_image_symbol(image_id image, char* symbol_name, int32 symbol_type, void** location)
:::

:::{cpp:function} status_t get_nth_image_symbol(image_id image, int32 n, int32* name_length, int32* symbol_type, void** location)
:::

get_image_symbol() returns, in {hparam}`location`, a pointer to the
address of the symbol that's identified by the {hparam}`image`,
{hparam}`symbol_name`, and {hparam}`symbol_type` arguments. An example
demonstrating the use of this function is given in "Symbols."

get_nth_image_symbol() returns information about the {hparam}`n`'th symbol
in the given {hparam}`image`. The information is returned in the arguments:

-   {hparam}`name` is the name of the symbol. You have to allocate the
{hparam}`name` buffer before you pass it inâ€”the function copies the name
into the buffer.

-   You point {hparam}`name_length` to an integer that gives the length of the
name buffer that you're passing in. The function uses this value to
truncate the string that it copies into name. The function then resets
{hparam}`name_length` to the full (untruncated) length of the symbol's name
(plus one byte to accommodate a terminating {cpp:expr}`NULL`). To ensure
that you've gotten the symbol's full name, you should compare the in-going
value of {hparam}`name_length` with the value that the function sets it to.
If the in-going value is less than the full length, you can then re-invoke
get_nth_image_symbol() with an adequately lengthened {hparam}`name` buffer,
and an increased {hparam}`name_length` value.

Keep in mind that name_length is reset each time you call
get_nth_image_symbol(). If you're calling the function iteratively (to
retrieve all the symbols in an image), you need to reset the
{hparam}`name_length` value between calls.

-   The function sets {hparam}`symbol_type` to
{cpp:enumerator}`B_SYMBOL_TYPE_DATA` if the symbol is a variable,
{cpp:enumerator}`B_SYMBOL_TYPE_TEXT` if the symbol is a function, or
{cpp:enumerator}`B_SYMBOL_TYPE_ANY` if the executable format doesn't
distinguish between the two. The argument's value going into the function
is of no consequence.

-   The function sets {hparam}`location` to point to the symbol's address.

To retrieve {htype}`image_id` numbers on which these functions can act,
use the {ref}`get_next_image_info()` function. Such numbers are also
returned directly when you load an add-on image through the
{ref}`load_add_on()` function.

:::{cpp:function} image_id load_add_on(const char* pathname)
:::

:::{cpp:function} status_t unload_add_on(image_id image)
:::

load_add_on() loads an add-on image, identified by {hparam}`pathname`,
into your application's address space.

-   {hparam}`pathname` can be absolute or relative; if it's relative, it's
reckoned off the base path specified by the ADDON_PATH environment
variable.

-   The function returns an {htype}`image_id` (a positive integer) that
represents the loaded image. Image ID numbers are unique across the system.

An example that demonstrates the use of load_add_on() is given in
"{cpp:func}`Loading an Add-on Image <Images::LoadingAnAddOnImage>`."

You can load the same add-on image twice; each time you load the add-on a
new, unique {htype}`image_id` is created and returned.

unload_add_on() removes the add-on image identified by the argument. The
image's symbols are removed, and the memory that they represent is freed.
If the argument doesn't identify a valid image, the function returns
{cpp:enumerator}`B_ERROR`. Otherwise, it returns {cpp:enumerator}`B_OK`.

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} thread_id load_image(int argc, const char** argv, const char ** env)
:::

Loads an app image into the system (it doesn't load the image into the
caller's address space), creates a separate team for the new application,
and spawns and returns the ID of the team's main thread. The image is
identified by the pathname given in {hparam}`argv`[0].

The arguments are passed to the image's main() function (they show up
there as the function's similarly named arguments):

-
	- Parameter

	- Description

-
	- argc
	- Gives the number of entries that are in the {hparam}`argv` array.
-
	- argv
	- Is a list of the parameters to be passed to the image. The first string in
		the {hparam}`argv` array must be the name of the image file. You then
		install any other arguments you want in the array, and terminate the array
		with a {cpp:expr}`NULL` entry. Note that the value of {hparam}`argc`
		shouldn't count {hparam}`argv`'s terminating {cpp:expr}`NULL`.
-
	- envp
	- Is an array of environment variables that are also passed to main().
		Typically, you use the global {hparam}`environ` pointer:

		:::{code} c
		extern char **environ;

		load_image(..., environ);
		:::

:::

The {hparam}`argv` and {hparam}`envp` arrays are copied into the new
thread's address space. If you allocated either of these arrays, it's safe
to free them immediately after load_image() returns.

The thread that's returned by load_image() is in a suspended state. To
start the thread running, you pass the {htype}`thread_id` to
{cpp:func}`resume_thread() <resume::thread>` or {ref}`wait_for_thread()`.

An example that demonstrates the use of load_image() is given in "Loading
an App Image."
