An area is a chunk of virtual memory that can be shared between threads
(possibly in different teams). If your application needs to allocate large
chunks of memory, or wants to share lots of data with another application,
you should consider using an area.

For more on area concepts, see "{ref}`Areas Overview`".

For examples of creating and sharing areas, see "{cpp:func}`Area Examples
<Areas::Examples>`".

## Area Functions

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} area_id area_for(void* addr)
:::

Returns the area that contains the given address (within your own team's
address space). The argument needn't be the starting address of an area,
nor must it start on a page boundary: If the address lies anywhere within
one of your application's areas, the ID of that area is returned.

Since the address is taken to be in the local address space, the area
that's returned will also be local—it will have been created or cloned by
your application.

-
	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_ERROR`.
	- The address doesn't lie within an area.

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} area_id clone_area(const char* clone_name, void** clone_addr, uint32 clone_addr_spec, uint32 clone_protection, area_id source_area)
:::

Creates a new area (the clone area) that maps to the same physical memory
as an existing area (the source area).

:::{list-table}
---
header-rows: 1
align: left
widths: auto
---
-
	- Parameter

	- Description

-
	- clone_name
	- Is the name that you wish to assign to the clone area. Area names are, at
		most, {cpp:enumerator}`B_OS_NAME_LENGTH` characters long.
-
	- clone_addr
	- Points to a value that gives the address at which you want the clone area
		to start; the pointed-to value must be a multiple of
		{cpp:enumerator}`B_PAGE_SIZE` (4096). The function sets the value pointed
		to by {hparam}`clone_addr` to the area's actual starting address—it may be
		different from the one you requested. The constancy of `*clone_addr`
		depends on the value of {hparam}`clone_addr_spec`, as explained next.
-
	- clone_addr_spec
	- Is one of four constants that describes how clone_addr is to be
		interpreted. The first three constants, {cpp:enumerator}`B_EXACT_ADDRESS`,
		{cpp:enumerator}`B_BASE_ADDRESS`, and {cpp:enumerator}`B_ANY_ADDRESS`, have
		meanings as explained under {cpp:func}`create_area() <create::area>`.

		The fourth constant, {cpp:enumerator}`B_CLONE_ADDRESS`, specifies that the
		address of the cloned area should be the same as the address of the source
		area. Cloning the address is convenient if you have two (or more)
		applications that want to pass pointers to each other—by using cloned
		addresses, the applications won't have to offset the pointers that they
		receive. For both the {cpp:enumerator}`B_ANY_ADDRESS` and
		{cpp:enumerator}`B_CLONE_ADDRESS` specifications, the value that's pointed
		to by the {hparam}`clone_addr` argument is ignored.
-
	- clone_protection
	- Is one or both of {cpp:enumerator}`B_READ_AREA` and
		{cpp:enumerator}`B_WRITE_AREA`. These have the same meaning as in
		{cpp:func}`create_area() <create::area>`; keep in mind, as described there,
		that a cloned area can have a protection that's different from that of its
		source.
-
	- source_area
	- Is the {htype}`area_id` of the area that you wish to clone. You usually
		supply this value by passing an area name to the {cpp:func}`find_area()
		<find::area>` function.

:::

The cloned area inherits the source area's locking scheme.

Usually, the source area and clone area are in two different applications.
It's possible to clone an area from a source that's in the same
application, but there's not much reason to do so unless you want the areas
to have different protections.

If clone_area() clone is successful, the clone's {htype}`area_id` is
returned. Otherwise, it returns a descriptive error code, listed below.

-
	- Return Code

	- Description

-
	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_BAD_VALUE`.
	- Bad argument value; you passed an unrecognized constant for
{hparam}`addr_spec` or {hparam}`lock`, the {hparam}`addr` value isn't a
multiple of {cpp:enumerator}`B_PAGE_SIZE`, you set {hparam}`addr_spec` to
{cpp:enumerator}`B_EXACT_ADDRESS` or {cpp:enumerator}`B_CLONE_ADDRESS` but
the address request couldn't be fulfilled, or {hparam}`source_area` doesn't
identify an existing area.

-
	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_NO_MEMORY`.
	- Not enough memory to allocate the system structures that support this area
(unlikely).

-
	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_ERROR`.
	- Some other system error prevented the area from being created.

::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} area_id create_area(const char* name, void** addr, uint32 addr_spec, uint32 size, uint32 lock, uint32 protection)
:::

Creates a new area and returns its {htype}`area_id`.

:::{list-table}

header-rows: 1
align: left
widths: auto
---
-
	- Parameter

	- Description

-
	- name
	- Is the name that you wish to assign to the area. It needn't be unique.
Area names are, at most, {cpp:enumerator}`B_OS_NAME_LENGTH` (32) characters
long.

-
	- addr
	- Points to the address at which you want the area to start. The value of
		`*addr` must signify a page boundary; in other words, it must be an integer
		multiple of {cpp:enumerator}`B_PAGE_SIZE` (4096). Note that this is a
		pointer to a pointer: `*addr`—not {hparam}`addr`—should be set to the
		desired address; you then pass the address of {hparam}`addr` as the
		argument, as shown below:

		:::{code} c
		/* Set the address to a page boundary. */
		char *addr = (char *)(B_PAGE_SIZE * 100);

		/* Pass the address of addr as the second argument. */
		create_area( "my area", &addr, ...);
		:::

		The function sets the value of `*addr` to the area's actual starting
		address—it may be different from the one you requested. The constancy of
		`*addr` depends on the value of {hparam}`addr_spec`, as explained next.
-
	- addr_spec
	- Is a constant that tells the function how the `*addr` value should be
		applied. There are three useful address specification constants, and one
		that doesn't apply here:

-
	- lock
	- Describes how the physical memory should be treated with regard to

		-
			- Constant

			- Description

		-
			- {cpp:enumerator}`B_FULL_LOCK`

		-
			- {cpp:enumerator}`B_CONTIGUOUS`

			- {cpp:enumerator}`B_NO_LOCK`
			- Pages are never locked, they're swapped in and out as needed.
		-

			- This is a special constant that's used for for areas that need to be
				locked, contiguous, and that fit within the first 16MB of physical memory.

		The protection you describe applies only to this area. If your area is
		cloned, the clone can specify a different protection.

If create_area() is successful, the new area_id number is returned. If
it's unsuccessful, one of the following error constants is returned.

-
	- Return Code

	- Description

-
	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_BAD_VALUE`.
	- Bad argument value. You passed an unrecognized constant for
		{hparam}`addr_spec` or {hparam}`lock`, the {hparam}`addr` or {hparam}`size`
		value isn't a multiple of {cpp:enumerator}`B_PAGE_SIZE`, or you set

		big.)
-
	- {cpp:enumerator}`B_ERROR`.
	- Some other system error prevented the area from being created.

::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} status_t delete_area(area_id area)
:::

Deletes the designated area. If no one other area maps to the physical
memory that this area represents, the memory is freed. After being deleted,
the {hparam}`area` value is invalid as an area identifier.

:::{admonition} Warning
:class: warning
Currently, anybody can delete any area—the act isn't denied if, for
example, the {htype}`area_id` argument was created by another application.
This freedom will be rescinded in a later release. Until then, try to avoid
deleting other application's areas.

::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} area_id find_area(const char* name)
:::

Returns an area that has a name that matches the argument. Area names
needn't be unique—successive calls to this function with the same argument
value may not return the same {htype}`area_id`.

What you do with the area you've found depends on where it came from:

-   If you're finding an area that your own application created or cloned, you
can use the returned ID directly.

-   If the area was created or cloned by some other application, you should
immediately clone the area (unless you're doing something truly innocuous,
such as simply examining the area's info structure).

:::

:::{code} c
struct {} area_info
:::

Copies information about a particular area into the {htype}`area_info`
structure designated by {hparam}`info`. The first version of the function
designates the area directly, by {htype}`area_id`.

The get_next_area_info() version lets you step through the list of a
team's areas through iterated calls on the function. The {hparam}`team`
argument identifies the team you want to look at; a {hparam}`team` value of
0 means the team of the calling thread. The {hparam}`cookie` argument is a
placemark; you set it to 0 on your first call, and let the function do the
rest. The function returns {cpp:enumerator}`B_BAD_VALUE` when there are no
more areas to visit:

:::{code} c
/* Get the area_info for every area in this team. */
area_info info;
int32 cookie = 0;

while (get_next_area_info(0, &cookie, &info) == B_OK)

-
	- size
	- Is the (virtual) size of the area, in bytes.
-
	- lock
	- Is a constant that represents the area's locking scheme. This will be one

		{cpp:enumerator}`B_LAZY_LOCK`, {cpp:enumerator}`B_NO_LOCK`, or
		{cpp:enumerator}`B_LOMEM`.
-

		{cpp:enumerator}`B_WRITE_AREA`.
-
	- team
	- Is the {htype}`team_id` of the team that created or cloned this area.
-
	- address
	- Is a pointer to the area's starting address. Keep in mind that this
		address is only meaningful to the team that created (or cloned) the area.

The final four fields give information about the area that's useful in
diagnosing system use. The fields are particularly valuable if you're
hunting for memory leaks:

-
	- Field

	- Description

-
	- ram_size
	- Gives the amount of the area, in bytes, that's currently swapped in.
-
	- copy_count
	- Is a "copy-on write" count that can be ignored—it doesn't apply to the
		areas that you create. The system can create copy-on-write areas (it does
		so when it loads the data section of an executable, for example), but you
		can't.

:::
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} status_t resize_area(area_id area, size_t new_size)
:::

Sets the size of the designated area to {hparam}`new_size`, measured in
bytes. The {hparam}`new_size` argument must be a multiple of
{cpp:enumerator}`B_PAGE_SIZE` (4096).

Size modifications affect the end of the area's existing memory
allocation: If you're increasing the size of the area, the new memory is
added to the end of area; if you're shrinking the area, end pages are
released and freed. In neither case does the area's starting address
change, nor is existing data modified (except, of course, for data that's
lost due to shrinkage).

Resizing affects all areas that refer to this areas physical memory. For
example, if B is a clone of A, and you resize A, B will be automatically
resized (if possible).

:::{cpp:function} status_t set_area_protection(area_id area, uint32 new_protection)
:::

Sets the given area's read and write protection. The new_protection
argument is a mask that specifies one or both of the values
{cpp:enumerator}`B_READ_AREA` and {cpp:enumerator}`B_WRITE_AREA`. The
former means that the area can be read; the latter, that it can be written
to. An area's protection only applies to access to the underlying memory
through that specific area. Different area clones that refer to the same
memory may have different protections.
