# Introduction

Welcome to the Haiku Book.

This is based off the original Be Book, updated with changes introduced in Haiku, and overall
improvements and clarifications to the original documentation.

## What is the Haiku Book?

The Haiku Book details the Application Programming Interface (API) to the Haiku(r) operating system.

## Organization of This Document

This document is split into three parts:

System Overview

: Provides an overview of the functionality provided by the System, broken down into Kits. This
should show you how the various classes interact with each other to produce the complete system.

Classes and Methods

: Details the classes/methods, what they do, which parameters you need to pass, the values they
return, etc.

Special Topics

: Details needed to program various parts of Haiku not covered under the kits, e.g. how to create
add-ons for the Tracker, create device drivers, etc.
