# Writing Modules

Modules provide services that can be used by other modules, by device
drivers, and by the kernel itself. They can be dynamically loaded and
unloaded by the kernel, as needed. If a client can't find a module it
needs, it will still load, which gives it the opportunity to find another
way to perform the desired tasks, or to disable those features of itself.

Modules, like drivers, export an API through a structure that provides
pointers to the functions provided by the module, along with other
information about the module. You do this by expanding upon the basic
module definition in drivers/module.h. For example, you might define your
module information structure like this:

:::{code} c
#define MY_MODULE_NAME "generic/mymodule/v1"

struct my_module_info {
   module_info module;
   int32 (*function1)();
   int32 (*function2)();
   void (*configure)(int32 parameter, int32 value);
};
:::

Note that the first field in your module information structure is a
{htype}`module_info`, which looks like this:

:::{code} c
struct module_info {
   const char*name;
   uint32 flags;
   status_t (*std_ops);
};
:::

The {hparam}`name` field should be a pointer to the driver's name as
indicated in your module's header file (in this example,
{cpp:enumerator}`MY_MODULE_NAME`).

The {hparam}`flags` field specifies which flags should be in effect for
your module. Currently, the {cpp:enumerator}`B_KEEP_LOADED` flag is the
only one available; as expected, it tells the kernel not to unload your
module when nobody is using it; normally, the first time your module is
requested by someone calling {cpp:func}`get_module() <get::module>`, the
kernel loads it. With each subsequent call to {cpp:func}`get_module()
<get::module>`, a reference count is incremented. Every time
{cpp:func}`put_module() <put::module>` is called to release the module, the
reference count is decremented. When the counter reaches zero, the module
is unloaded. {cpp:enumerator}`B_KEEP_LOADED` prevents unloading from taking
place.

{hparam}`std_ops` is a pointer to a function that your module must
provide. This function is called to handle standard module operations.
Currently, there are only two of these operations (initialization and
uninitialization). Your module's std_ops() function will probably look
something like this:

:::{code} c
static status_t std_ops(int32 op, ...) {
   switch(op) {
      case B_MODULE_INIT:
         /* do whatever you need to do */
         break;
      case B_MODULE_UNINIT:
         /* do whatever you need to do */
         break;
      default:
         return B_ERROR;   /* necessary, for future expansion */
   }
   return B_OK;
}
:::

It's important to return {cpp:enumerator}`B_ERROR` for any unknown
operations, in case future versions of the kernel define additional
operations.

Exporting your module to the outside world is similar to publishing device
driver hooks, but since you define the hooks yourself, it's slightly more
involved. Your module needs to have a filled-out version of your module's
information structure, like this:

:::{code} c
static struct my_module_info my_module {
   {
      MY_MODULE_NAME,   /* module name */
      0,   /* flags */
      std_ops
   },
   function1,
   function2,
   configure
};
:::

When loading your module, the kernel looks for a symbol called "modules"
that contains a list of pointers to the modules you export, terminated by a
{cpp:expr}`NULL`:

:::{code} c
_EXPORT module_info*modules[] = {
   (module_info*) &my_module,
   NULL
};
:::

This is how the kernel finds out what modules are available for use by
drivers (or by other modules). See the "{ref}`Using Modules`" section for
details on how modules are accessed by other drivers or modules.

## Module Functions

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} status_t get_module(const char* path, module_info** info)
:::

Declared in: drivers/module.h

The get_module() function obtains infomation about the module at the
{hparam}`path` specified and increases the modules internal reference
count.
::::

::::{abi-group}
:::{cpp:function} status_t put_module(const char* path)
:::

Declared in: drivers/module.h

This function decreases the modules internal reference count and if the
count is zero the module is unloaded from memory
