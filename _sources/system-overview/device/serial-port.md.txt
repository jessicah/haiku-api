# BSerialPort

A {cpp:class}`BSerialPort` object represents an RS-232 serial connection
to the computer. Through {cpp:class}`BSerialPort` functions, you can read
data received at a serial ports and write data over the connection. You can
also configure the connectionâ€”for example, set the number of data and stop
bits, determine the rate at which data is sent and received, and select the
type of flow control (hardware or software) that should be used.

To read and write data, a {cpp:class}`BSerialPort` object must first open
one of the serial ports by name. To find the names of all the serial ports
on the computer, use the {cpp:func}`CountDevices()
<BSerialPort::CountDevices>` and {cpp:func}`GetDeviceName()
<BSerialPort::GetDeviceName>` functions:

:::{code} cpp
BSerialPort serial;
char devName[B_OS_NAME_LENGTH];
int32 n = 0;

for (int32 n = serial.CountDevices() - 1; n >= 0; n--) {
   serial.GetDeviceName(n, devName);

   if ( serial.Open(devName) > 0 )
      ....
}
:::

The {cpp:class}`BSerialPort` object communicates with the driver for the
port it has open. The driver maintains an input buffer to collect incoming
data and a smaller output buffer to hold outgoing data. When the object
reads and writes data, it reads from and writes to these buffers.

The serial port drivers, and therefore {cpp:class}`BSerialPort` objects,
send and receive data asynchronously only.
