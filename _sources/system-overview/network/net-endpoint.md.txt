# BNetEndpoint

The {cpp:class}`BNetEndpoint` class represents a network endpoint, which
can send and receive data, establish network connections, bind to local
addresses, and listen for and accept new connections.

Rather than replacing the existing network architecture, the
{cpp:class}`BNetEndpoint` class provides a C++ wrapper to the standard
socket functions. All the same rules of usage apply, so be sure to review
the BSD-like C socket function material.

## Archiving BNetEndpoints

{cpp:class}`BNetEndpoint` objects are archivable. All attributes of the
{cpp:class}`BNetEndpoint` are preserved when archived. Upon
reinstantiation, the object is duplicated precisely. This has interesting
ramificationsâ€”if the {cpp:class}`BNetEndpoint` is connected to a remote
system when it's archived, the reinstantiated archive will also be
connected to that system. You can actually archive active connections to
restore them later.

Obviously, however, protocol-specific information won't be saved unless
you add that data to the archive yourself. For example, if you archive an
FTP connection, then restore the connection from the archive, the working
directory or any ongoing downloads won't be restored automatically.
