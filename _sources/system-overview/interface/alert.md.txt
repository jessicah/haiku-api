# BAlert

A {cpp:class}`BAlert` displays a modal window that notifies the user of an
error (or the like), and provides a set of buttons (three buttons, max)
that lets the user respond to the situation. For example, here's a typical
"unsaved changes" alert:

![Example BAlert](./images/TheInterfaceKit/alert.png)

When the user clicks one of the buttons, the alert panel is automatically
removed from the screen, the index of the chosen button (0,1, or 2, left to
right) is reported to your app, and the {cpp:class}`BAlert` object is
deleted.

The buttons are automatically aligned within the panel (as shown above).
The rightmost button is the default buttonâ€”i.e., it's mapped to the Enter
key. You can assign your own shortcuts through the {cpp:func}`SetShortcut()
<BAlert::SetShortcut>` function (don't use
{hmethod}`BWindow::AddShortcut()`).

## Construction and Deletion

{cpp:class}`BAlert` objects must be constructed with new; you can't
allocate a {cpp:class}`BAlert` on the stack.

A {cpp:class}`BAlert` object deletes itself when it's removed from the
screen. You never need to delete the {cpp:class}`BAlert` objects that you
display.

## Creating and Running an Alert Panel

The following code creates and displays the alert panel shown above:

:::{code} cpp
BAlert *myAlert = new BAlert("title", "Save changes to ...")
    "Cancel", "Don't save", "Save",
    B_WIDTH_AS_USUAL, B_OFFSET_SPACING, B_WARNING_ALERT);

myAlert->SetShortcut(0, B_ESCAPE);
int32 button_index = alert->Go();
:::

This is the canonical "Do it/Don't do it/Cancel" alert. Any alert that has
a Cancel button should map the {hkey}`Escape` key as a shortcut, as shown
here.

The {cpp:func}`Go() <BAlert::Go>` function runs the panel: It displays the
panel, removes the panel when the user is done, and returns the index of
the button that the user clicked.

## Asynchronous Alerts

The default (no argument) version of {cpp:func}`Go() <BAlert::Go>` shown
above is synchronous: It doesn't return until the user clicks a button.
There's also an asynchronous version of {cpp:func}`Go() <BAlert::Go>` that
returns immediately and (optionally) sends back the user's response in a
{cpp:class}`BMessage`. See {cpp:func}`Go() <BAlert::Go>` for details.

## Look and Feel

By default, a {cpp:class}`BAlert` object uses the
{cpp:enumerator}`B_MODAL_APP_WINDOW_FEEL`. This means that it blocks your
application's other windows. If you want to broaden the feel so it blocks
all windows ({cpp:enumerator}`B_MODAL_ALL_WINDOW_FEEL`), or restrict it so
it blocks only a few of your app's windows
({cpp:enumerator}`B_MODAL_SUBSET_WINDOW_FEEL`), call
{cpp:func}`BWindow::SetFeel`. In the subset case, you'll also have to call
{cpp:func}`BWindow::AddToSubset`.

:::{admonition} Note
:class: note
Never change the object's look ({cpp:enumerator}`B_MODAL_WINDOW_LOOK`).
