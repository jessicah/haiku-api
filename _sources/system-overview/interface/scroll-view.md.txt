# BScrollView

A {cpp:class}`BScrollView` object is a container for some other view (the
target view). The {cpp:class}`BScrollView` creates and positions scroll
bars around the target view, and makes itself the parent of the scroll bars
and the target view. When the user moves the scroll bars, the target view
scrolls.
