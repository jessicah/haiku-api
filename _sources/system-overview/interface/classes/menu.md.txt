# BMenu

A {cpp:class}`BMenu` object displays a pull-down or pop-up list of menu items. A menu can contain
simple menu items ({cpp:class}`BMenuItem` objects), or other menus (other {cpp:class}`BMenu`s). To
add an item to a menu, call {cpp:func}`~BMenu::AddItem()`.

## Menu Hierarchy

Menus are hierarchically arranged; an item in one menu can control another menu. The controlled menu
is a submenu; the menu that contains the item that controls it is its supermenu. A submenu remains
hidden until the user operates the item that controls it; it becomes hidden again when the user is
finished with it.

The menu at the root of the hierarchy is displayed in a window as a list - perhaps a list of just
one item. Since it, unlike other menus, doesn't have a controlling item, it must remain visible. A
root menu is therefore a special kind of menu in that it behaves more like an ordinary view than do
other menus, which stay hidden. Root menus should belong to the {cpp:class}`BMenuBar` class, which
is derived from {cpp:class}`BMenu`. The typical root menu is a menu bar displayed across the top of
a window.

## Menu Items

Each item in a menu is a kind of {cpp:class}`BMenuItem` object. An item can be marked (displayed
with a check mark to its left), assigned a keyboard shortcut, enabled and disabled, and given a
"trigger" character that the user can type to invoke the item when its menu is open on-screen.

Every item has a particular job to do. If an item controls a submenu, its job is to show the submenu
on-screen and hide it again. All other items give instructions to the application. When invoked by
the user, they deliver a {cpp:class}`BMessage` to a target {cpp:class}`BHandler`. What the item does
depends on the content of the {cpp:class}`BMessage` and the {cpp:class}`BHandler`s response to it.
