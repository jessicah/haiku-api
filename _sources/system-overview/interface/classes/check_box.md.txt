# BCheckBox

A {cpp:class}`BCheckBox` object draws a labeled check box on-screen and responds to a keyboard
action or a click by changing the state of the object: When the user "checks" the check box, the
object displays an "x" within its border, its state is set to {cpp:enum}`B_CONTROL_ON`, and the
invocation message is sent to the object's target. When the user "unchecks" the check box, the "x"
is removed, the state is set to {cpp:enum}`B_CONTROL_OFF`, and the invocation message is sent.
