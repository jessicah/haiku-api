# BOutlineListView

A {cpp:class}`BOutlineListView` displays a list of items that can be
structured like an outline, with items grouped under other items. The
levels of the outline are indicated by successive levels of indentation.

![Outline ListView](./images/TheInterfaceKit/outlinelist.png)

The outline list view shown above was created using the following code:

:::{code} cpp
BOutlineListView *outline;
BListItem *region;
BListItem *state;

SetViewColor(216,216,216,0);

r = Bounds();
r.InsetBy(5,5);
r.right -= 16;
r.top += 20;

outline = new BOutlineListView(r, "cities_list",
               B_MULTIPLE_SELECTION_LIST);
:::

First, the {cpp:class}`BOutlineListView` is created, with a rectangle
computed by insetting from the parent view's bounds rectangle. The
{cpp:enumerator}`B_MULTIPLE_SELECTION_LIST` flag is specified to indicate
that the user should be allowed to choose more than one item in the list.

:::{code} cpp
region = new BStringItem("United States of America")
outline->AddItem(region);
:::

This creates a new item in level 0 (the "region" level).

The United States is then divided into states, which comprise level 1 of
the outline list. This line of code adds California to the list, placing it
"under" the region (United States of America):

:::{code} cpp
state = new BStringItem("California")
outline->AddUnder(state, region);
:::

a pointer to the new item for California is saved in the variable
{hparam}`state`.

:::{code} cpp
outline->AddUnder(new BStringItem("Menlo Park"), state);
outline->AddUnder(new BStringItem("Los Angeles"), state);
:::

California is then further divided into cities: Menlo Park and Los
Angeles, which reside at level 2 of our outline list. These are inserted
under the California item by specifying the pointer to that item (locality)
when calling {cpp:func}`AddUnder() <BOutlineListView::AddUnder>`.

This process is repeated for New York state, which has three cities
available in our list:

:::{code} cpp
locality = new BStringItem("New York")
outline->AddUnder(locality, region);
outline->AddUnder(new BStringItem("Albany"), locality);
outline->AddUnder(new BStringItem("Buffalo"), locality);
outline->AddUnder(new BStringItem("New York City"), locality);
:::

Then the Europe region is added (in level 0), and the nations of France,
Germany, and Italy are added as localities (level 1). Each of those three
localities has cities, which are added into level 2.

:::{code} cpp
region = new BStringItem("Europe")
outline->AddItem(region);
locality = new BStringItem("France")
outline->AddUnder(locality, region);
outline->AddUnder(new BStringItem("Paris"), locality);

locality = new BStringItem("Germany")
outline->AddUnder(locality, region);
outline->AddUnder(new BStringItem("Berlin"), locality);
outline->AddUnder(new BStringItem("Hamburg"), locality);

locality = new BStringItem("Italy")
outline->AddUnder(locality, region);
outline->AddUnder(new BStringItem("Milan"), locality);
outline->AddUnder(new BStringItem("Rome"), locality);
:::

Once the list has been completely constructed, a {cpp:class}`BScrollView`
is created to contain the outline list view, and is then added to the list.
See the {cpp:class}`BScrollView` class for details on how this works:

:::{code} cpp
AddChild(new BScrollView("scroll_cities", outline,
         B_FOLLOW_LEFT|B_FOLLOW_TOP, 0, false, true));
:::

Finally, a {cpp:class}`BStringView` is created to label the list with a
prompt indicating that you should "Select the Cities to Attack:".

:::{code} cpp
r = Bounds();
r.InsetBy(5,5);
r.bottom = r.top + 12;
AddChild(new BStringView(r, "message_string",
      "Select the Cities to Attack:"));
:::

## Outline Structure

If an item has other items under it—that is, if the immediately following
item in the list is at a deeper level of the outline—it is a superitem; the
items grouped under it are its subitems. Superitems are marked by a
triangular icon or latch, in the usual interface for hypertext lists.

The user can collapse or expand sections of the outline by manipulating
the latch. When a section is collapsed, only the superitem for that section
is visible (and the latch points to the superitem). All items that follow
the superitem are hidden, up to the next item that's not at a deeper
outline level. When a section is expanded, subitems are visible (and the
latch points downward).

## Inherited Functions

The {cpp:class}`BOutlineListView` class inherits most of its functionality
from the {cpp:class}`BListView` class. However, inherited functions are
concerned only with the expanded sections of the list, not with sections
that are hidden because they're collapsed. If an inherited function returns
an index or takes an index as an argument, the index counts just the items
that are shown on-screen (or could be shown on-screen if they were scrolled
into the visible region of the view). {cpp:func}`DoForEach()
<BListView::DoForEach>` skips items that can't be displayed.
{cpp:func}`CountItems() <BListView::CountItems>` counts items only in the
expanded sections of the list.

However, the functions that the {cpp:class}`BOutlineListView` class itself
defines are concerned with all sections of the list, expanded or collapsed.
For its functions, an index counts all items in the list, whether visible
or not.

The class defines some functions that match those it inherits, but its
versions prefix {hmethod}`FullList…()` to the function name and don't
ignore any items. For example, {cpp:func}`FullListCountItems()
<BOutlineListView::FullListCountItems>` counts every item in the list and
{cpp:func}`FullListDoForEach() <BOutlineListView::FullListDoForEach>`
doesn't skip items in collapsed sections.

In some cases, {cpp:class}`BOutlineListView` simply overrides an inherited
function without adding the {hmethod}`FullList…()` prefix. You should
always use the {cpp:class}`BOutlineListView` versions of these functions,
not the {cpp:class}`BListView` versions. For example,
{cpp:class}`BOutlineListView`'s version of {cpp:func}`MakeEmpty()
<BOutlineListView::MakeEmpty>` truly empties the list;
{cpp:class}`BListView`'s version would remove items from the screen, but
not from the real list.
