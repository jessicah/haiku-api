# BSlider

A slider is a control that provide a standard way for the user to select a
value from a predetermined range; for example, if your application needs to
let the user pick a value between 1 and 100, it's easy to create a
{cpp:class}`BSlider` object that the user can use to do this. Sliders can
be either horizontal or vertical.

{cpp:class}`BSlider` objects also provide a wide assortment of hooks that
let you customize the appearance and behavior of your slider controls.

## Using BSliders

Creating a basic BSlider is very simple:

:::{code} cpp
r.Set(5,5,255,55);
slider = new BSlider(r, "const:slider1",
                     "Construct Speed (%)", NULL,
                     0, 140);
:::

This creates a slider named "const:slider1" with the label "Construct
Speed (%)" above it. The range of possible values for the slider is 0 to
140.

You can add a splash of color to the slider, too. For example, if you want
the slider bar to be light blue, you might add:

:::{code} cpp
slider->SetBarColor(color);
:::

You can also add hash marks to the slider:

:::{code} cpp
slider->SetHashMarks(B_HASH_MARKS_BOTTOM);
slider->SetHashMarkCount(10);
:::

In this example, {hmethod}`SetHashMarks()` is used to specify that the
hash marks should be below the slider; you can also specify
{cpp:enumerator}`B_HASH_MARKS_TOP` to put them above the slider,
{cpp:enumerator}`B_HASH_MARKS_BOTH` to put them both above and below the
slider, and {cpp:enumerator}`B_HASH_MARKS_NONE` to omit them entirely
(which is the default).

{hmethod}`SetHashMarkCount()` is called to indicate that you want 10 hash
marks spaced evenly across the slider.

Finally, if you want to add labels at the ends of the slider, to indicate
the minimum and maximum values, you can use the {cpp:func}`SetLimitLabels()
<BSlider::SetLimitLabels>` function:

:::{code} cpp
slider->SetLimitLabels("Slow", "Fast");
:::

This sets the label for the minimum value (the left end of the slider) to
"Slow" and the label for the maximum to "Fast".

The result is the "Construct Speed (%)" slider in the window pictured
below. An example of a slider with the {cpp:enumerator}`B_TRIANGLE_THUMB`
thumbType and hash marks above and below the slider is also shown.

## Customizing a BSlider

You can customize the appearance of your BSlider by overriding virtual
functions in the {cpp:class}`BSlider` class that are responsible for
drawing the slider bar, thumb, focus mark, and hash marks.

For example, let's say you want your slider's thumb to be round. Just
create a new class—let's call it CustomSlider—derived from
{cpp:class}`BSlider`, and override the {cpp:func}`DrawThumb()
<BSlider::DrawThumb>` function with code that might look something like
this:

:::{code} cpp
const rgb_color kWhite = {255,255,255,255};
const rgb_color kWhiteGray = {235,235,235,255);
const rgb_color kDarkGray = {100,100,100,255};
const rgb_color kBlackColor = {0,0,0,255};

void CustomSlider::DrawThumb(void) {
   BRect r;
   BView *v;

   // Get the frame rectangle of the thumb
   // and the offscreen view.

   r = ThumbFrame();
   v = OffscreenView();

   // Draw the black shadow

   v->SetHighColor(kBlackColor);
   r.top++;
   r.left++;
   v->StrokeEllipse(r);

   // Draw the dark grey edge

   v->SetHighColor(kDarkGray);
   r.bottom--;
   r.right--;
   v->StrokeEllipse(r);

   // Fill the inside of the thumb

   v->SetHighColor(kWhiteGrayColor);
   r.InsetBy(1,1);
   v->FillEllipse(r);
}
:::

All rendering of a {cpp:class}`BSlider` is done into an offscreen view,
which you can get a pointer to by calling the {cpp:func}`OffscreenView()
<BSlider::OffscreenView>` function. This improves performance and makes
drawing the slider—especially complicated ones—look much smoother to the
user.

This code gets a pointer to the offscreen view, then renders a round,
beveled thumb into the offscreen view, filling the thumb's frame rectangle
as returned by the {cpp:func}`ThumbFrame() <BSlider::ThumbFrame>` function.

The result is a round thumb that looks like the one in the "Totality of
Damage" slider in the picture below:
