# BRadioButton

A {cpp:class}`BRadioButton` object draws a labeled, two-state button
that's displayed in a group along with other similar buttons. The button
itself is a round icon that has a filled center when the
{cpp:class}`BRadioButton` is turned on, and is empty when it's off. The
label appears next to the icon.

Only one radio button in the group can be on at a time; when the user
clicks a button to turn it on, the button that's currently on is turned
off. One button in the group must be on at all times; the user can turn a
button off only by turning another one on. The button that's on has a value
of 1 ({cpp:enumerator}`B_CONTROL_ON`); the others have a value of 0
({cpp:enumerator}`B_CONTROL_OFF`).

The {cpp:class}`BRadioButton` class handles the interaction between radio
buttons in the following way: A direct user action can only turn on a radio
button, not turn it off. However, when the user turns a button on, the
{cpp:class}`BRadioButton` object turns off all sibling
{cpp:class}`BRadioButton`s—that is, all {cpp:class}`BRadioButton`s that
have the same parent as the one that was turned on.

This means that a parent view should have no more than one group of radio
buttons among its children. Each set of radio buttons should be assigned a
separate parent—perhaps an empty {cpp:class}`BView` that simply contains
the radio buttons and does no drawing of its own.
