# BPoint

{cpp:class}`BPoint` objects represent points on a two-dimensional
coordinate grid. The object's coordinates are stored as public {hparam}`x`
and {hparam}`y` data members. The {cpp:class}`BPoint` class declares a
global object, {cpp:enumerator}`B_ORIGIN`, that represents (0,0).

For an overview of coordinate geometry for the BeOS, see "{ref}`The
Coordinate Space`".
