# BScreen

A {cpp:class}`BScreen` object represents a single display screen that's
connected to the computer. With a {cpp:class}`BScreen` object you can…

-   Get and set the screen's size and pixel depth.

-   Get the screen's color map.

-   Make a screen shot.

-   Set the desktop color.

-   Synchronize your code with the screen's retrace event.

You can't copy a {cpp:class}`BScreen` object—the copy constructor and
assignment operators are private.

## Multiple Screens

Although, the BeOS currently only supports a single screen, in the future
it will let the user hook up multiple screens. One of the screens, the main
screen, will have the origin of the screen coordinate system at its left
top corner. Other screens will be located elsewhere in the same coordinate
system. If there's just one screen, it's the main screen.

A {cpp:class}`BScreen` object represents one screen. An application can
have more than one object referring to the same screen.

When multiple screens are supported, a screen_id identifier will be
assigned to each one. Currently, {cpp:enumerator}`B_MAIN_SCREEN_ID` is the
only identifier.
