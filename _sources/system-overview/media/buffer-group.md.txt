# BBufferGroup

A {cpp:class}`BBufferGroup` serves as a repository for
{cpp:class}`BBuffer`s, and can be used to pass those buffers to another
node for its use when sending data. It must also be used by your
{cpp:class}`BBufferProducer` to acquire {cpp:class}`BBuffer`s to put data
that you produce into before you send the buffer on to its destination.

You can create a new {cpp:class}`BBufferGroup` by simply calling:

:::{code} cpp
new BBufferGroup;
:::

If you pass in some arguments describing what sort of buffers you want,
and how many of them, the group will even create the {cpp:class}`BBuffer`s
for you. This is how you'll usually use {cpp:class}`BBufferGroup`, from
within your {cpp:class}`BBufferProducer` subclass' constructor so you'll
know there are buffers ready and waiting when it's time to start sending
data. A possible exception is if your node is a filter that simply
processes buffers it receives and passes them along.

A {cpp:class}`BBufferGroup` instance runs a thread that reclaims
{cpp:class}`BBuffer`s whose {cpp:func}`Recycle() <BBuffer::Recycle>`
function has been called. If the group is temporarily out of free buffers,
a request for a buffer may block until one is available, or until the
request times out, if a timeout is specified when the request is made.

## Using BBitmaps as Buffers

If you're doing video processing, you might want your buffers to be
{cpp:class}`BBitmap`s. Here's how you can accomplish this:

:::{code} cpp
BBufferGroup *my_group = new BBufferGroup;
BBitmap *my_bitmap = new BBitmap(BRect(0,0,639,479), B_BITMAP_IS_AREA,
            B_RGB32, 640*4);

if (!my_bitmap->IsValid()) {
   return B_ERROR;
}
area_info bm_info;

if (get_area_info(my_bitmap->Area(), &bm_info) != B_OK) {
   return B_ERROR;
}

buffer_clone_info bc_info;
bc_info.area = bm_info.area;
bc_info.offset = ((char *) my_bitmap->Bits())-((char *) bm_info.address);
bc_info.size = my_bitmap->BitsLength();

BBuffer *out_buffer = NULL;
status_t err = my_group->AddBuffer(bc_info, &out_buffer);

/* out_buffer is now set to use the BBitmap's memory */
:::

This code takes advantage of the {cpp:enumerator}`B_BITMAP_IS_AREA` flag
when creating the bitmap. This forces the bitmap to be in a memory area of
its very own, which you can then use when creating the
{cpp:class}`BBuffer`.

If you need to do real-time accesses to the {cpp:class}`BBuffer`, you
should lock it down. In addition, if you use DMA, you'll need to specify
for the buffer to be contiguous (you can do this using the
{cpp:class}`BBitmap` constructor, specifying the contiguous flag).

Before deleting any {cpp:class}`BBitmap`s used in this way, be sure the
buffer group has been deleted first and (if
{cpp:func}`SetOutputBuffersFor() <BBufferConsumer::SetOutputBuffersFor>`
has been used) all buffers have been reclaimed.
