# BBufferProducer

A {cpp:class}`BBufferProducer` is a {cpp:class}`BMediaNode` that emits
buffers containing media data that other nodes
({cpp:class}`BBufferConsumer`s in particular) will receive and,
potentially, process. If your node wants to emit buffers, it must be
derived from {cpp:class}`BBufferProducer` and override the hook functions
to implement the {cpp:class}`BBufferProducer` protocol.

## Video Clipping

Currently, the only video clipping format supported by the Media Kit is
{cpp:enumerator}`B_CLIP_SHORT_RUNS`, although there is a function in this
class for converting between this format and {cpp:class}`BRegion`s.

This format begins with a header, consisting of two {htype}`int16` values:

:::{list-table}
---
header-rows: 1
align: left
widths: auto
---
-
	- Field

	- Description

-
	- offsetX
	- X offset for all following coordinates.
-
	- offsetY
	- Y offset for all following coordinates.

:::

These values indicate the offset for the X and Y coordinates indicated
throughout the rest of the clipping data.

The remainder of the clipping data consists of entries indicating each
line of video data, as follows:

:::{list-table}
---
header-rows: 1
align: left
widths: auto
---
-
	- Field

	- Description

-
	- numShorts
	- The number of values in the {hparam}`coordList`. Always an even number. If
		negative, repeats the previous entry {hparam}`numShorts` times.
-
	- coordListâ€¦
	- List of coordinates. Even entries are left-edge X coordinates, odd entries
		are right-edge X coordinates.

:::

The clipping data contains one of these entries for each time the clipping
information changes.

For example, if the clipping is a rectangle with the left edge at 100, top
edge at 50, right edge at 300, and bottom edge at 200, the clipping data
for a 640x480 display might be:

:::{code} sh
header
   offsetX: 0
   offsetY: 50

entry 1
   numShorts: 2
   coordList: 100, 300

entry 2
   numShorts: -150

entry 3
   numShorts: 2
   coordList: 0, 639

entry 4
   numShorts: -280
:::

The header indicates that the clipping data begins at row 50.

The first entry indicates that clipping should span from column 100 to
column 300 on the first row of clipping (row 50). The second entry says to
repeat this 150 times.

Entry 3 indicates that clipping from that point on should be from column 0
to column 639 (the entire width of the display). Entry 4 causes this to
repeat 280 times, to the bottom of the display.

## Seek Tags

In order to support media formats that don't provide timing information in
their outer encapsulation layer, or to provide enhanced seeking performance
for media formats that support key frames, the Media Kit supports the
concept of seek tags. Producers that know their data doesn't have timing
information, or that can provide enhanced seeking using special tags,
should put a tag in the {hparam}`user_data` field of the buffer headers it
sends. This tag can contain any data the producer wants.

Consumers that can derive good timing information from these packets after
decoding them should then choose appropriate seek points (usually key
frames) and cache the performance time and tag values of the first buffer
that arrives at that seek point.

Producers that can't seek without help from the decoder can then query the
consumer by calling {cpp:func}`FindSeekTag()
<BBufferProducer::FindSeekTag>`. This causes the consumer's
{cpp:func}`SeekTagRequested() <BBufferConsumer::SeekTagRequested>` function
to be called. This returns the seek tag and time that are closest to the
requested time. The producer can then use this information locate the
appropriate point in the media data.

The easiest way to use this is to use the file offset as the tag data, but
any value that makes sense to the producer can be used, since the consumer
just saves a copy of the data and passes it back without looking at it.

:::{code} sh
Time          Seek Tag
0.0 seconds   0
0.1 seconds   <none>
0.2 seconds   2
0.3 seconds   <none>
:::

In this simple example, we have four buffers, two of which have seek tags
recorded (at 0.0 seconds and 0.3 seconds). If the producer is seeking to
0.2 seconds, it would call {cpp:func}`FindSeekTag()
<BBufferProducer::FindSeekTag>`, like this:

:::{code} cpp
media_seek_tag tag;
bigtime_t time;
FindSeekTag(&destination, 0.2*1000000, &tag, &time);

/* now we can use the tag to seek */
:::

If the tag contains a file offset, we can simply seek to that offset in
the file and we're ready to go.

In this example, the returned tag is "2" and the time is 0.2 seconds,
because there's a seek tag located precisely at the requested time.
However, if we look for a seek tag for 0.1 seconds, we get a returned tag
of "0" and a time of 0.0 seconds, because that's the closest matching tag
to the requested time.
