# BControllable

A node whose behavior can be controlled by the user should be derived from
{cpp:class}`BControllable`, as well as from whatever other interface
classes the node might be derived from. Deriving from
{cpp:class}`BControllable` lets the node publish information about the
parameters that can be adjusted and how they relate to each other.

A client application can use the published information to build a user
interface for the node or pass the information through to a system routine
that will build the interface.

A node can also have the ability to start its own control panel under
outside control, which can take advantage of special knowledge of the node.
