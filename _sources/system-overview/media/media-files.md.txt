# BMediaFiles

One feature provided by the Media Kit is the ability to assign media files
(sounds and graphics files, for example) to named elements, which can then
be used to locate user-configured sound and graphics options.

That's the technical way of saying that the Media Kit provides the ability
to assign sounds and bitmap graphics to events and system attributes, so
you can configure the appearance and behavior of your BeOS computer's user
interface.

## Identifying an Entry

Each entry in the media files registry consists of three elements: a type,
an item name, and an {cpp:func}`entry_ref <entry::ref>`. The type is the
type of media data the entry represents. For example, this could be "sound"
or "bitmap." The item name is the actual name of the entry in the registry,
such as "Startup" or "desktop image." The {cpp:func}`entry_ref
<entry::ref>` identifies the file that's been assigned to that particular
entry.

An application can instantiate a {cpp:class}`BMediaFiles` object and then
use the {cpp:func}`GetRefFor() <BMediaFiles::GetRefFor>` function to find
out what file is assigned to a particular registry entry. For instance, if
your application needs to access the desktop image file, you can get this
information as follows:

:::{code} cpp
entry_ref ref;

if (GetRefFor("bitmap", "desktop image", &ref) == B_OK) {
   /* have your way with the desktop image file */
}
:::

The user uses the Sounds preference application to assign sound files to
events, such as the system beep and the startup sound. These are named
"Beep" and "Startup" respectively. The {ref}`beep()` function will always
play whatever sound is assigned to the Beep event.
