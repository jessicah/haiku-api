# BCursor

You can use a {cpp:class}`BCursor` to represent a mouse cursor as an
object instead of as a block of pixel data; this can be more convenient in
some situations. Also, if you want to call
{cpp:func}`BApplication::SetCursor` without forcing an immediate sync of
the Application Server, you have to use a {cpp:class}`BCursor`.

The default {cpp:class}`BCursor`s are
{cpp:enumerator}`B_CURSOR_SYSTEM_DEFAULT` for the hand cursor and
{cpp:enumerator}`B_CURSOR_I_BEAM` for the I-beam text editing cursor.

## Cursor Data Format

The first four bytes of cursor data give information about the cursor:

:::{list-table}
---
header-rows: 0
align: left
widths: auto
---
-
	- Byte 1
	- Size in pixels-per-side. Cursors are always square; currently, only
		16-by-16 cursors are allowed.
-
	- Byte 2
	- Color depth in bits-per-pixel. Currently, only one-bit monochrome is
		allowed.
-
	- Bytes 3 & 4
	- Hot spot coordinates. Given in "cursor coordinates" where (0,0) is the
		upper left corner of the cursor grid, byte 3 is the hot spot's y
		coordinate, and byte 4 is its x coordinate. The hot spot is a single pixel
		that's "activated" when the user clicks the mouse. To push a button, for
		example, the hot spot must be within the button's bounds.

Next comes an array of pixel color data. Pixels are specified from left to
right in rows starting at the top of the image and working downward. The
size of an array element is the depth of the image. In one-bit depthâ€¦

the 16x16 array fits in 32 bytes. 1 is black and 0 is white.

Then comes the pixel transparency bitmask, given left-to-right and
top-to-bottom. 1 is opaque, 0 is transparent. Transparency only applies to
white pixels, black pixels are always opaque.
