# BVolumeRoster

The {hclass}`BVolumeRoster` class keeps track of the volumes that are
mounted in the file system hierarchy. It lets you know about volumes in two
ways:

-   It lists the volumes that are currently mounted. You can step through the
list through iterative calls to the {cpp:func}`GetNextVolume()
<BVolumeRoster::GetNextVolume>` function.

-   It lets you know when new volumes are mounted, and when existing volumes
are unmounted. (See {cpp:func}`StartWatching()
<BVolumeRoster::StartWatching>`.)

How you create your {hclass}`BVolumeRoster` object depends on what you're
going to do with it:

-   If you simply want to step through the volume list, then creating a
{hclass}`BVolumeRoster` on the stack is sufficient.

-   However, if you want to watch for volumes being mounted and unmounted,
then you must keep your {hclass}`BVolumeRoster` object around. The watching
stops when the object is deleted.

A single {hclass}`BVolumeRoster` object can perform both functions: You
can use it to step through the volume list at the same time that it's
watching volumes.
