# BInputDevice

A {cpp:class}`BInputDevice` object is a "downstream" representation of an
Input Server device, such as a mouse or a keyboard, within a "regular"
application. The {cpp:class}`BInputDevice` can {cpp:func}`Start()
<BInputDevice::Start>` and {cpp:func}`Stop() <BInputDevice::Stop>` the
device it represents, and can send it input device control messages through
its {cpp:func}`Control() <BInputDevice::Control>` function.

You never create {cpp:class}`BInputDevice` objects yourself; instead, you
ask the system to return one or more instances to you through the
{ref}`find_input_device()` or {ref}`get_input_devices()` functions.
Alternatively, you can work without an object by invoking the static
versions of {cpp:func}`Start() <BInputDevice::Start>`, {cpp:func}`Stop()
<BInputDevice::Stop>`, and {cpp:func}`Control() <BInputDevice::Control>`.
Note, however, that the static functions control all devices of a given
type, whereas a {cpp:class}`BInputDevice` instance can talk to a specific
device.

{cpp:class}`BInputDevice` objects don't live in the Input Serverâ€”they're
used in "normal" applications as a means to control an Input Server device
add-on.

The {cpp:class}`BInputDevice` object is provided, primarily, to let an
application talk to a custom input device.

You never subclass {cpp:class}`BInputDevice`.
