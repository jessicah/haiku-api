<h1 id="CPPv412Introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Writing device drivers requires additional knowledge of the inner workings
of the BeOS. To write a driver you must follow the rules laid out in this
chapter very carefully. These rules are not the same as those for writing a
normal application—if your driver tries to do things it’s not allowed to
do, it could bring down the system.</p>
<p>This introduction covers how drivers interact with the kernel.</p>
<section id="the-kernel-and-the-driver-author">
<h2>The Kernel and the Driver Author<a class="headerlink" href="#the-kernel-and-the-driver-author" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The BeOS kernel comprises the basic functionality of the operating system:
It knows how to start the boot process and to manage memory and threads,
and it contains the PCI bus manager, the ISA bus manager, the device file
system (devfs, which manages /dev), the root file system (rootfs, which
manages /), and a few other things.</p>
<p>But this isn’t enough to satisfy the needs of most applications, so the
kernel uses add-ons to provide additional functionality. During the boot
process, add-ons are loaded to handle “real” file systems, devices, busses,
and the like.</p>
<p>Although Be’s kernel add-ons provide support for a wide range of
hardware—from disk devices to joysticks—this support isn’t all-inclusive.
Hardware developers may need to create their own drivers for their
products.</p>
<section id="types-of-kernel-add-on">
<h3>Types of Kernel Add-on<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-kernel-add-on" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are three types of kernel add-on:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Device drivers are add-ons that communicate directly with devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Modules are kernel space add-ons that export an API for use by drivers (or
by other modules).</p></li>
<li><p>File systems are add-ons that support specific file systems, such as BFS,
DOSFS, HFS, and so forth.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Device drivers and file systems, while extending the functionality of the
kernel, are still accessible from user space: Applications can open and
address them using file descriptors. Modules, on the other hand, are
kernel-only units. Applications have no access to them; they’re provided
strictly for use by the kernel and other kernel add-ons.</p>
<section id="device-drivers">
<h4>Device Drivers<a class="headerlink" href="#device-drivers" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>A device driver is an add-on that recognizes a specific device (or class
of devices) and provides a means for the rest of the system to communicate
with it. Usually this communication involves some form of device-specific
protocol. For example, if the system wants to use an Ethernet card or
graphics card, it needs to load a device driver add-on that knows how to
communicate with that card. Similarly, code that knows how to talk to a
class of devices (SCSI disks, ATA devices, ATAPI disks, or USB input
devices, etc.) must be implemented as a device driver add-on.</p>
</section>
<section id="modules">
<h4>Modules<a class="headerlink" href="#modules" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Modules provide a uniform API for use by other modules and drivers. A
module is like a library in that it acts as a repository for common code
that’s shared among several drivers.</p>
<p>For example: Let’s say you have a device driver that talks to a SCSI
device connected to a SCSI bus. A computer can have multiple SCSI busses.
Because all SCSI devices use the same command set independent of the
particular controller used to send the commands, the command set can be
(and is) implemented as a module. The SCSI module knows how to handle all
SCSI cards the BeOS supports; the API that the SCSI module defines is
adopted by and augmented by the modules for specific SCSI device types
(hard disks, scanners, CD drives, etc). The SCSI device modules are managed
by a SCSI bus manager module, which knows how to cope with multiple busses
and presents them in encapulated form to the drivers. The drivers then only
need to deal with the bus manager’s API, which makes the life of a driver
author much simpler.</p>
<p>Be provides bus managers for SCSI, USB, IDE, and PCMCIA.</p>
</section>
<section id="file-systems">
<h4>File Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#file-systems" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>File system add-ons provide support for disk and network file systems,
such as BFS, HFS, FAT, ISO 9660, CIFS, and so forth. By creating new file
system add-ons, developers can provide access to disks that are formatted
using other file system.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="interactions-with-the-kernel">
<h3>Interactions with the Kernel<a class="headerlink" href="#interactions-with-the-kernel" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The kernel provides a number of services that drivers and modules can use.
These include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Enabling and disabling interrupts.</p></li>
<li><p>Setting up memory for DMA transactions.</p></li>
<li><p>Access to other devices and modules.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The kernel also provides, at the user level, a Posix-like API for
accessing devices. An application can open a device through open(), and use
read(), write(), and ioctl() to access the device.</p>
<p>The Posix functions are converted into system calls into the kernel, which
then passes them, via devfs, to the appropriate device driver.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="devfs">
<h2>devfs<a class="headerlink" href="#devfs" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The kernel manages device drivers through devfs, the device file system
that’s mounted at /dev during the boot process. In order to be accessed, a
driver must “publish” itself by adding an entry in the /dev hierarchy. The
basic Posix I/O functions (open(), read(), write(), readv(), writev(),
ioctl(), and close()) can then be used.</p>
<p>Devfs makes the drivers available as needed in /dev; this usually happens
the first time a program iterates through the directory entries for a
subdirectory in /dev. The kernel knows where in the /dev hierarchy to
publish drivers based on their location in
/boot/beos/system/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev. For example, the ATAPI driver
publishes drivers in /dev/disk/ide/atapi, the driver is located in
/boot/beos/system/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/disk/ide/atapi. Whew.</p>
<p>You can see this device hierarchy by using the “ls” command from a
Terminal window. ls /dev will show you the root of the device hierarchy, ls
/dev/disk will show you disk device busses, ls /dev/disk/ide will show you
the IDE devices, and so forth.</p>
<p>In reality, drivers tend to publish themselves in multiple locations in
the /dev hierarchy, so instead of putting duplicate copies of the driver in
the …/drivers/dev tree, the driver binaries are put at
/boot/beos/system/add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin, and symlinks are created in
the …/drivers/dev tree at the appropriate place. (The same is also done for
drivers in /boot/home/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/…)</p>
</section>
<section id="driver-implementation-principles">
<h2>Driver Implementation Principles<a class="headerlink" href="#driver-implementation-principles" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Much of the stability of the BeOS is achieved by constructing a nearly
impenetrable wall between the kernel and user applications. Drivers are
chinks in that wall. If a driver misbehaves or fails, there’s a strong
possibility that it will cause unexpected behavior or kill the entire
system. It’s absolutely critical that drivers not only be very carefully
tested before being released to the public, but that they follow the rules
to the letter.</p>
<section id="kernel-space-vs-user-space">
<h3>Kernel Space vs. User Space<a class="headerlink" href="#kernel-space-vs-user-space" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>One way you can reduce the risk of your driver causing a general system
failure is by putting as much code as possible in user space. Create a
driver that loads into kernel space just enough code to handle the
low-level interactions that absolutely have to be done in kernel space,
then load code into user space to handle the rest of the work. If the
add-on fails, the system will keep running—only your driver will fail.</p>
<p>Another plus to placing as much of your code as possible into user space
is that it’s much easier to debug code running in user space. Conventional
debugging techniques that don’t work for kernel code can be applied, and
there’s much less chance of taking down the system in the process.</p>
</section>
<section id="code-synchronization">
<h3>Code Synchronization<a class="headerlink" href="#code-synchronization" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Normally, spinlocks are a bad thing. A spinlock is a tight loop that
watches for a condition to occur, looping endlessly until that condition is
met (this is called “busy waiting”). This wastes valuable processor time,
and is normally discouraged.</p>
<p>In general, you’re encouraged to use semaphores instead of spinlocks;
however, you can’t acquire a semaphore while handling an interrupt. So if
you need to synchronize code while handling an interrupt, you must use a
spinlock. Put simply:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use spinlocks to protect critical sections in interrupt-handling code.</p></li>
<li><p>Use semaphores in any other situation that calls for code synchronization.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Anywhere you use a spinlock to protect a critical section, you should
disable interrupts. Of course, in an interrupt handler, you know that
interrupts are already disabled, so you don’t need to explicitly disable
interrupts yourself. Interrupt handlers include I/O interrupts installed
using install_io_interrupt() and timer interrupts installed by calling
add_timer().</p>
<section id="functions-available-during-spinlocks">
<h4>Functions Available During Spinlocks<a class="headerlink" href="#functions-available-during-spinlocks" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>While your spinlock is running, you can perform the following actions. If
it’s not on this list, you can’t do it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You can examine and alter hardware registers by using the appropriate bus
manager hooks.</p></li>
<li><p>You can examine and alter any locked-down memory.</p></li>
<li><p>You can call the following kernel functions: system_time(), atomic_add(),
atomic_or(), atomic_and().</p></li>
<li><p>You can call the following bus manager functions: read_io_<em>() and
write_io</em>().</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you do anything else inside your spinlock, you’re breaking the rules,
so don’t do it.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-spinlocks">
<h4>Using Spinlocks<a class="headerlink" href="#using-spinlocks" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>You need to be sure that your calls to acquire_spinlock() and
release_spinlock() are balanced. In addition, if you nest spinlocks, they
must be released in logical order—that is, in the opposite order in which
they’re acquired.</p>
<p>The kernel keeps track of which spinlocks are being held and which are
being waited upon. The kernel assumes that spinlocks are initialized to 0,
and then acquired and released in logical order.</p>
<p>By keeping track of spinlocks, the kernel can detect and break deadlocks
on multiprocessor systems.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="disabling-interrupts">
<h3>Disabling Interrupts<a class="headerlink" href="#disabling-interrupts" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The only time you should ever disable interrupts in a device driver is
just before entering a spinlock-protected critical section. There is
absolutely no other reason to do it, so don’t.</p>
<p>After disabling interrupts, you should reenable them as quickly as
possible. You must never, under any circumstances, leave interrupts
disabled for more than 50 microseconds. This means that your interrupt
handler code (which runs with interrupts implicitly disabled) must execute
in 50 microseconds or less.</p>
<section id="functions-available-while-interrupts-are-disabled">
<h4>Functions Available While Interrupts Are Disabled<a class="headerlink" href="#functions-available-while-interrupts-are-disabled" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>If you have interrupts disabled and aren’t in a spinlock, you can do the
following things in addition to those listed above in “Functions Available
During Spinlocks”:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You can call release_sem_etc() with the
<code class="xref cpp cpp-enumerator docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B_DO_NOT_RESCHEDULE</span></code> flag set.</p></li>
<li><p>You can call get_sem_count(), add_timer(), cancel_timer(), and dprintf().</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel that you need to call a function not explicitly listed as
permitted here, please contact Be Developer Support at devsupport&#64;be.com
and explain your needs; we’d be happy to discuss the situation with you.</p>
</section>
<section id="don-t-block">
<h4>Don’t Block<a class="headerlink" href="#don-t-block" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>It’s crucial that your interrupt handler never block, whether directly (by
acquiring a semaphore, for example) or indirectly (by calling a function
that might block).</p>
<p>Blocking can happen in a surprisingly large number of BeOS functions. It’s
obvious that acquire_sem() can block, but you might not be aware that
functions such as malloc() or read_port() can block. Even touching unlocked
memory areas can block because of virtual memory hits.</p>
<p>The point is this: If the BeOS function you want to call isn’t explicitly
listed in this section as one you can use, don’t call it.</p>
</section>
<section id="don-t-preempt">
<h4>Don’t Preempt<a class="headerlink" href="#don-t-preempt" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Your interrupt handler or spinlock section can’t be preempted. Preemption
could occur if you call release_sem() or release_sem_etc() without
specifying the <code class="xref cpp cpp-enumerator docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B_DO_NOT_RESCHEDULE</span></code> flag. Normally,
release_sem() lets the scheduler preempt your thread to allow other threads
to acquire the semaphore as fast as possible. By specifying
<code class="xref cpp cpp-enumerator docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B_DO_NOT_RESCHEDULE</span></code>, you tell the scheduler to allow your
thread to continue running after it releases the semaphore.</p>
<p>If your interrupt handler wants to ensure that any preemption is handled
immediately, it should specify <code class="xref cpp cpp-enumerator docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B_DO_NOT_RESCHEDULE</span></code> when
calling release_sem(), then return <code class="xref cpp cpp-enumerator docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B_INVOKE_SCHEDULER</span></code>.
This causes the scheduler to immediately handle preemption after your
interrupt handler returns, instead of resuming the interrupted task. This
is especially useful if your code called release_sem_etc() to release a
semaphore that will allow other code to run elsewhere (such as in your
driver’s corresponding user-space code).</p>
<div class="warning admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Again, when you call release_sem_etc(), be sure to specify the
<code class="xref cpp cpp-enumerator docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B_DO_NOT_RESCHEDULE</span></code> flag to avoid any chance of
preemption.</p>
</div>
<p>In summary, the order in which you should do things is this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Disable interrupts.</p></li>
<li><p>Acquire the spinlock.</p></li>
<li><p>Perform your tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>Release the spinlock.</p></li>
<li><p>Restore the original interrupt state.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="file-i-o">
<h4>File I/O<a class="headerlink" href="#file-i-o" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Sometimes a driver needs to be able to access disk files. Perhaps the
driver has a preference file it needs to read. There are two ways to do
this. You can use Posix I/O calls, or you can use the driver settings API
provided by BeOS. The latter is preferred.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-posix-calls">
<h4>Using Posix Calls<a class="headerlink" href="#using-posix-calls" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Under BeOS, device drivers can access disk files using the standard
low-level Posix I/O functions: open(), close(), read(), write(), and so
forth. There aren’t any special chores to attend to beforehand. Just open()
the file and do your thing.</p>
<p>Two Posix extensions that might be helpful when you’re writing code to
perform file I/O from a device driver: readv() and writev().</p>

</div>
<p>These functions provide a means to read and write contiguous portions of a
file from multiple buffers. vector is a pointer to an array containing
count vector records, each of which contains a pointer to a buffer, and the
size of the buffer. readv() fills these buffers with data from the file,
and writev() writes them to the file, in order.</p>
<p>When successful, readv() returns the number of bytes read.</p>
<p>For example, if your code needs to write two separate 1k buffers into a
file, one after the other, you might do something like this:</p>
